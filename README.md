# Advent of Code 2023 (C#)

[![.NET](https://github.com/davidalucas/aoc-2023-cs/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/davidalucas/aoc-2023-cs/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

This is a C# project for solving the AoC 2023 problems in C#. For this project, I'm going with JetBrains Rider for the
IDE, .NET 8 for the runtime, and xUnit for the tests. I'm also using FluentAssertions in the xUnit project, just because
I like the assertions a bit better than the default ones that come with xUnit.
